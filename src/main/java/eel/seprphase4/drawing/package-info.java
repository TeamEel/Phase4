/**
 * This package provides a Sprite Canvas, Sprites, and sprite management functions. <p> The SpriteCanvas is a Java Swing
 * widget which provides a surface on which to draw moving, animated sprites. It holds a background image over which the
 * Sprites are drawn. <p> Sprites are drawn onto the canvas according to their Z-order. This allows sprites to be
 * stacked on top of each other in a systematic way, with some sprites being closer to the foreground than others.
 * Transparency in sprites is also handled correctly (natively by Java). <p> The Sprite class encapsulates a set of
 * animations which have a position. A Sprite can be animated (with different sets of animations selected according to
 * the state of the object which the sprite is representing), drawn onto an awt Graphics object, and moved according to
 * both relative and absolute coordinates. <p> The critical classes for clients of this package are SpriteCanvas and
 * Sprite; Coordinate will also be needed but is a trivial container. <p> SpriteSet is a first-class collection of
 * sprites, for the convenience of SpriteCanvas. ZSprite is a Sprite wrapper which associate a Z-value with a sprite,
 * and makes it easy for SpriteSet to order sprites by Z-value. ImageLoader is a helper class that loads images stored
 * in .jar resources into awt Image objects. None of these classes need concern clients of the package; none of them are
 * sufficiently complex to require more detailed exposition here.
